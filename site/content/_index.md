intro:
  heading: "What Are Fantasy Consoles?"
  text: "Fantasy consoles are consoles that don't really exist. Fantasy consoles are different from emulators where they emulate already made consoles such as the Super Nintendo and Atari but with a Fantasy console, we are playing and creating games for a console (in this case, a program) that someone else made!"

    text: "Fantasy consoles is a neat way for us young developer who never knew what it was like to code/program back in the hay day of the 80s. With the constant stream of new Fantasy Consoles being release and worked on. It's a nice change of pace for us to be able to boot up Pico-8 or Basic8 and code like we would have back then."
About:
  heading: About Us
  text: Coffee is an amazing part of human culture but it has a dark side too – one of colonialism and mindless abuse of natural resources and human lives. We want to turn this around and return the coffee trade to the drink’s exhilarating, empowering and unifying nature.
